 💡 If the setup feels complicated, you can use the [Strategy Definition Assistant](./StrategyDefinition.md) to generate a complete factor strategy in one click.

- **Step 1: Create a trading account**  
  > Use [Account Management](./StrategyDefinition.md) to create or link brokerage accounts as execution carriers for strategies.
  
- **Step 2: Define trading rules**  
  > Apply global trading risk controls such as target position, trading behavior, fund allocation, rule switches, order frequency, and unattended execution. Configure them in [Trading Rules](./StrategyDefinition.md).

- **Step 3: Define trading targets**  
  > Two sources: stock pools generated by stock-picking models, or advanced scheduled tasks. Create pools in [Custom Stock Pool](./StrategyDefinition.md), assign priorities, weights, and trading behaviors for fine-grained control.

- **Step 4: Choose factor libraries**  
  > Each account has two strategies: buy and sell. The buy strategy → buy factor library; the sell strategy → sell factor library. Define these in [Factor Library Design](./StrategyDefinition.md). Underlying data is created in [Factor Data Sources](./StrategyDefinition.md).
 
- **Step 5: Assemble strategies**  
  > After preparation, use [Strategy Definition](./StrategyDefinition.md) to create buy/sell strategies and assign accounts, pools, stock factor libraries, and index factor libraries.
    
- **Step 6: Launch strategies**  
  > Start strategies via [Run Factor Strategy](./StrategyDefinition.md). The system continuously monitors stock pools and executes trades once conditions are met.

## FAQ
- **Do I need to learn a programming language?**  
  > No. You can use the platform without coding. Advanced users may write or adjust SQL scripts. The system also auto-generates most SQL scripts for easy operation.

- **Does it support local deployment?**  
  > Yes. Full support for on-premise or private deployment. You can run it on your own servers, LAN, or PC without relying on third-party cloud services.

- **Does it support real-time market data?**  
  > Yes, with Level-2 exchange data feeds, plus compatibility with third-party providers.

- **Can real-time market snapshots be stored?**  
  > Yes. Supports snapshots at 1m, 3m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, 60m, and daily intervals. Custom intervals are also supported.

- **How does live trading work?**  
  > Two ways: (1) database-level data exchange; (2) file-level data exchange. The system already integrates with major brokerage order routing systems.

- **Does the system support third-party strategy databases?**  
  > Yes. Import your own or third-party strategy libraries without coding. Strategies can be called, combined, and executed directly in the system.

- **Do I need to install third-party runtimes?**  
  > No. The system includes all core runtime environments and dependencies out of the box.
